- 3D-printed housing (recommended)

## Instructions
1. Connect the FFC (Flat, Flexible Cable) to the Raspberry Pi Camera connector.
2. Route the cable around the aluminum extrusion on one side of the printer, making sure that it lays flat on the bottom.
3. Replace the bottom plate on the printer.
   - Make sure the FFC is not pinched or twisted.
   - Make sure the FFC is between mounting screws.
4. Put the Raspberry Pi camera in the 3D-printed housing and attach somewhere on the top of the printer.
